# NiFi Weather Pipeline

## Overview
The NiFi Weather Pipeline project is designed to facilitate real-time data ingestion from the OpenWeatherMap API using Apache NiFi. This project leverages NiFi's powerful data flow capabilities to extract, transform, and load weather data into a structured format for further analysis.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

```
nifi-weather-pipeline
├── docker
│   └── docker-compose.yml          # Configuration for running NiFi using Docker Compose
├── nifi
│   └── flows
│       └── bigdataweather.xml      # NiFi flow configuration for weather data ingestion
├── docs
│   ├── setup_instructions.md        # Step-by-step setup instructions for the NiFi environment
│   ├── screenshots                  # Directory for screenshots of the NiFi UI
│   └── report_template.md           # Template for writing the project report
├── output                            # Directory for storing output CSV files generated by NiFi
├── .env                              # Environment variables for Docker configuration
└── README.md                         # Project overview and instructions
```

## Setup Instructions
To set up the NiFi Weather Pipeline, follow the instructions in the `docs/setup_instructions.md` file. This document provides detailed steps for configuring the Docker environment and running the NiFi instance.

## Usage
After setting up the environment, you can access the NiFi UI at `https://localhost:8443/nifi`. From there, you can monitor the data flow, configure processors, and view the output generated by the pipeline.

## Output
The output CSV files generated by the NiFi pipeline will be stored in the `output` directory. You can review these files for the transformed weather data.

## Documentation
For additional information, refer to the following documents:
- **Setup Instructions**: Detailed steps for setting up the NiFi environment.
- **Report Template**: A template for documenting the project and its findings.
- **Screenshots**: Visual aids illustrating the flow logic and data transformation within the NiFi UI.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the capabilities of Apache NiFi for real-time data ingestion and transformation. By following the provided setup instructions, you can easily replicate the pipeline and explore the data flow functionalities of NiFi.
